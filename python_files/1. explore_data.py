# # Explore the Midwest Survey dataset
#
# In this notebook, we will explore the **Midwest Survey** dataset from [skrub](https://skrub-data.org/).
#
# This dataset contains survey responses from people across the United States,
# asking them about their perception of the Midwest region.
#
# The goal is to predict the **Census Region** where a respondent lives,
# based on their survey answers.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load the dataset

# %%
from skrub.datasets import fetch_midwest_survey

dataset = fetch_midwest_survey()

# X contains the features (the survey answers)
X = dataset.X
# y contains the target (the Census Region)
y = dataset.y

# %% [markdown]
# ## Question 1: How many examples are there in the dataset?
#
# Use the `.shape` attribute to find out the number of rows and columns.

# %%
# Display the number of rows and columns


# %%
# You can also look at the first few rows of the dataset
X.head()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Question 2: What is the distribution of the target?
#
# The target variable `y` tells us the Census Region of each respondent.
# Let's see how many respondents belong to each region.

# %%
# Count how many respondents belong to each region


# %%
# Visualize the target distribution with a bar plot
# hint: use barh


# %% [markdown]
# Is the target balanced (roughly the same number of examples per class) or imbalanced?

# %% [markdown]
# ## Question 3: What are the features that can be used to predict the target?
#
# Let's look at the column names and their data types.

# %%
# List all column names


# %%
# Show data types for each column


# %% [markdown]
# How many features are numerical? How many are categorical (text)?

# %%

# %%
from skrub import TableReport
TableReport(X)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Question 4: Are there any missing values in the dataset?
#
# Missing values can cause problems for machine learning models.
# Let's check if there are any.

# %%
# Check for NaN missing values


# %% [markdown]
# Missing values can sometimes be encoded differently. Let's look at some columns more closely.

# %%
# Look at unique values for the Household_Income column
# #X["Household_Income"].??

# %%
# Look at unique values for the Education column

# %% [markdown]
# Do you see a special value that could represent missing data?

# %% [markdown]
# ## Question 5: What is the most common answer to "How much do you identify as a Midwesterner"?
#
# Let's explore this important feature.

# %%
# TODO: display the value counts for the column
# "How_much_do_you_personally_identify_as_a_Midwesterner"


# %%
# TODO: make a bar plot of the results


# %% [markdown]
# ## Bonus: Explore another feature
#
# Pick another column and explore its distribution.
# For example: `Gender`, `Age`, or one of the
# "Do you consider X state as part of the Midwest" columns.

# %%
# TODO: explore a column of your choice
